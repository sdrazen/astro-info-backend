# Astro Info Backend

This is backend for the [Astro Info web application](https://github.com/sdrazen/astro-info).

## Installing

```bash
npm install
```

## Prerequisites

If you want to develop your own backend for your own astronomy web application, you can do it by modifying this code. Unless you want to remove some of the functionalities, you will need following:

- `MongoDb URI`
- `Flickr API key`
- `NASA API key`
- `Google Timezone API key`

Put appropriate values in `common/globals.js` file and you are good to go.

## Usage

Modify code at your own taste, recreate the [database](https://github.com/sdrazen/astro-info/tree/master/src/assets/data) or create your own and publish your new backend.
